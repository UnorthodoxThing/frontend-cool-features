## Tips

* Use **link** if your main concern is subcategories.

Reason: For accessibility - vistors to your page are not always going to be using a pointing device (which is required for the hovering and revealing of sub-menus)

## Supporting older browsers

The IE only style sheet is loaded using the conditional comment

<!--[if lte IE 6]>
<link rel="stylesheet" media="all" type="text/css" href="css/dropdown_ie.css" />
<![endif]-->
