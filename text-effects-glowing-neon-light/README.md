A glowing neon light text effect.

## Keynotes

_svg_ image extensions will not be on display by CSS background-image UNLESS given a dimension width and height. Otherwise, the browser uses the size that's specified in the _svg_ itself, similar to how it treats an ordinary image. e.g. If your container is 100px tall, but your _svg_ is 200px, only half of it will show. Use the `background-size` property to resize it.

-strikethrough => or simply attach it to the body ONLY via outerlink.
