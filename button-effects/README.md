## Keynotes

+ When designing buttons, be consistent. Won’t only contribute to a great-looking design, but it’ll also provide a more familiar experience for users

+ Cues to tell that users which element they are looking at. Such as, _shadows_ and _highlights_. Drop-shadows make the element stand out against the background and make it easily identifiable as a tappable or clickable element, as objects that appear raised look like they could be pressed down, (tapped or clicked). Even with flat buttons (almost flat, to be exact), there are still places for these subtle cues.

> If a button casts a subtle shadow, users tend to understand that the element is interactive.

+ Clearly label Buttons

**Clear and distinct labels**

The label on actionable interface elements, such as a button, should always tie back to what it will do for the user. Users will feel more comfortable when they understand what action a button does.

Such explicit labels serve as just-in-time help, giving users confidence in selecting the correct action.

+ Put Buttons Where Users Can Find Them

**Location and Order**

If you’re designing a native app, you should follow platform GUI guidelines when choosing a proper location and order for buttons. Why? Because applying consistent design that follows user expectations saves people time.

Other devices (e.g. web-based) will require testing to determine which is the right fit.

+ Make It Easy For Users To Interact With Buttons

**Size and Padding**

consider how large a button is in relation to the other elements on the page. Ensure the buttons you design are large enough for people to interact with.

[MIT Touch Lab study](http://touchlab.mit.edu/publications/2003_009.pdf)  found that the average size of finger pads are between 10–14mm and fingertips are 8–10mm, making **10mm x 10mm** a good minimum touch target size. When a mouse and keyboard are the primary input methods, button measurements can be slightly reduced to accommodate dense UIs.

Consider the padding between clickable elements as well, as padding helps separate the controls and gives your user interface enough breathing space.

**Provide Visual Feedback**

Usually, a button isn’t a one-state object. It has multi-states, and providing visual feedback to users to indicate the current state should be a top priority task.

e.g.

- normal

- focused

- pressed

- disabled

+ Visually Highlight the Most Important Buttons

Ensure the design puts emphasis on the primary or most prominent action. Use color and contrast to keep user focus on the action, and place the button in prominent locations where users are most likely to notice it.

**Call-To-Action Button**

Important buttons, (such as CTAs,) are meant to direct users into taking the action you want them to take. To create an effective call-to-action button, one that grabs the user’s attention and entices them to click, you should use colors with a high contrast in relation to the background and place the button in the path of a user.

e.g. Gmail's UI, Behance website

**Visual Distinctions for Primary and Secondary Buttons**

When choosing between primary and secondary actions, visual distinctions are a useful method for helping people make solid choices.

The _primary_ positive action associated with a button needs to carry a stronger visual weight. It should be the visually dominant button.

_Secondary_ actions, (e.g. options like ‘Cancel’ or ‘Go Back’,) should have the weakest visual weight, because reducing the visual prominence of secondary actions minimizes the risk for potential errors, and further directs people toward a successful outcome.

+ Button Design Checklist

To ensure your button design is right for your users, you need to ask a few questions:

- **Are users identifying your element as a button?** Think about how the design communicates affordance. Make a button look like a button (use size, shape, drop-shadows and color for that purpose).

- **Does a button’s label provide a clear message** as to what will happen after a click? It’s often better to name a button, explaining what it does, than to use a generic label, (like “OK”).

- **Can your user easily find the button?** Where on the page you place the button is just as important as its shape, color and the label on it. Consider the user’s path through the page and put buttons where users can easily find them or expect them to be.

- If you have two or more buttons in your view, (e.g. dialog box), **does the button with the primary action have strongest visual weight?** Make the distinction between two options clear, by using different visual weight for each button.

+ Buttons have voice and stronger

Buttons are fundamental interface elements. However, they help establishing voice and tone of product.

Serious - sharp edges

Neutral - rounded corners

Friendly - pill shape

+ Create proper button hierarchy

User interface should guide users towards their goals. Give them visual clues on where to click next.

+ Provide visual Feedback:

When button is pressed...

show upload motion; They can change their form based on the input from the user.

+ Increase touch and click area

example

Regular 44px / 44px

On Touch or Click 44px / 44px (+25%)

Touch tagerts

10mmm radius

Increase with +25% = 15mm radius

Try to add invisible area around button which is going to help users to click more easily especially on mobile

+ Give buttons breathing space

+ Use (consistent) descriptive labels

+ Focus on Accessibility e.g. contrast
