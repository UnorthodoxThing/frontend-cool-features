# Landing Page 01

Simple landing page that snaps into place too.
See for browser compatibility.
"scroll-behaviour" is not available in Firefox, Chrome and Opera. Not available in Safari, Edge and IE. However, you may use JQuery (JS uses more codes) and a lightweight script called "Smooth Scroll".

NB: No JavaScript

# Keynotes

`scroll-behavior: smooth` - Allows the smooth transition or jump from sections of the page.

`scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` - Target the vertical axis scroll feature and imperative

`scroll-snap-align: center` - Where the property is placed, it centers on that element

Not cross-browser compatible (e.g. Opera does not have this feature).

### Discontinued CSS Property

`scroll-snap-points-y` - Defines the vertical positioning of snap points within the content of the scroll container they are applied to. It is similar to `scroll-snap-align`.
