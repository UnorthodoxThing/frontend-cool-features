# Landing Page 01

Simple landing page that snaps into place too.
See for browser compatibility.
"scroll-behaviour" is not available in Firefox, Chrome and Opera. Not available in Safari, Edge and IE. However, you may use JQuery (JS uses more codes) and a lightweight script called "Smooth Scroll".

NB: No JavaScript
